# Battleship
Fun battleship implementation I made with my brother
It just plays to randomized computers against each other, displays every move and wether it was a hit, a miss, or sunk a ship, then at the end prints out the two boards, with all hits and misses. I made this with my middle school brother to teach him a little more about python
